- 👋 Hi, I’m @olympus Peter Phiri My journey as a Software Engineer started way back in the year 2019 when I was introduced to Linux terminal for the first time. I began with the ambition of becoming an unethical-hacker. I advanced my Kali Linux skills to the point were I decided to develop an unhackable solution (website). At this very moment I realized I was an IT Solutions Expert.-
